        <p class="text-muted">Prithvi cafe is pretty famous in Mumbai already because of it's very reasonable pricing
          and it's artistic ambience. Whike the ambience is pretty cozy, I am disappointed by the slow service by the
          cafe management. Even for water, we had to wait for 20 minutes and the food was also not worth the wait.

          We ordered Nachos that were bland and the Spaghetti didn't taste good either. However, their Cocum Cooler is a
          must try and I also liked their Hummus and Pita Bread.

          Well I think, it can be a go to place for college goers but for those who like to enjoy good food, they might
          not like this place much.</p>

        <p class="text-muted">Exactly when Raja Jai Singh began construction in Jaipur is unknown, but several
          instruments had been built by 1728, and the construction of the instruments in Jaipur continued until 1738.
          During 1735, when construction was at its peak, at least 23 astronomers were employed in Jaipur, and due to
          the changing political climate, Jaipur replaced Delhi as Raja Jai Singh's main observatory and remained Jai
          Singh's central observatory until his death in 1743. The observatory lost support under Isvari Singh
          (r.1743-1750) because of a succession war between him and his brother. However, Mado Singh (r. 1750â€“1768),
          Isvari Singh's successor, supported the observatory, although it did not see the same level of activity as
          under Jai Singh. Although some restorations were made to the Jantar Mantar under Pratap Singh (r.1778-1803),
          activity at the observatory died down again. During this time, a temple was constructed and Pratap Singh
          turned the site of the observatory into a gun factory.[citation needed]</p>

        <p>I watched it today with my kids and they loved it. You should have a minimal previous understanding of the
          story, or you will miss 40% of the fun. You should watch Infinity War, Civil War, Black Panther, Age of
          Ultron,
          Ant-Man and the Wasp before watching Avengers: Endgame. The entire movie pays homage to most of the other
          Marvel
          superhero movies. You will enjoy it a lot. There is, at the beginning of the movie, a (spoiler alert) head
          dismemberment that is quite impressive. The movie is based on the most-talked action-packed Sci-fi series. The
          movie shows how the Avengers assemble once more in order to reverse Thanos' actions and restore balance to the
          universe. The movie is lengthy, and it does run for 3 hours all worthwhile

        <p>This is a fantastic movie, and I am not lying! my 13 year old sister loves this movie, and I can't fault this
          either. It was one of the first movies I ever saw, so that accounts for how much I love it. The animation is
          superb, the backgrounds look so rich, and for once, there are no stiff movements. The highlights were the
          stampede and the fight between Scar and Simba. The music by Hans Zimmer is outstanding, a perfect mix of
          African chants and pure Hollywood. The songs are absolutely great, I had no idea that Elton John could write
          like that. The best song is "Can you feel the Love Tonight?" but the others go without fault, "Circle of Life"
          is so spirit rousing especially. Likewise with the voice overs. Jonathan Taylor Thomas is very likable as
          Young Simba, and Matthew Broderick, while not as good, is above average too. James Earl Jones lends his
          booming voice to the majestic King Mufassa, and Nathan Lane, Rowan Atkinson and Whoopi Goldberg provide
          flawless comic relief. The vocal standout is Jeremy Irons as Scar, who frightened me when I was little. Scar
          is up there with the best Disney villains, like Jafar, Malificent and Frollo. The humour here is fantastic,
          and you cry here a bit here as well. I highly recommend the stage version in the West End, and the sequels are
          actually two of the better DTV sequels.10/10. Bethany Cox
